### Challenges
Reverse an Array

## Lab 2 | Arrays, Loops, Imports, ArrayLists

### Challenges
  - Roll
    - roll a dice n number of times, return array of that length
  - Contains Duplicates

    - iterate through array of arrays to find which array has the lowest average

## Lab 3 | Analyzing Weather Data, Tallying Votes

### Challenges
  - Analyzing Weather Data
    - scan through array of arrays to find the min of all the temperatures.
    - scan through array of arrays to find the max of all the temperatures.
    - when scanning through array, push all temperatures into a HashSet
    - scan through from min to max checking if temp is in HashSet, print message if not.
  - Tallying Votes
    - create HashMap of possible votes
    - tally votes inside HashMap
    - scan HashMap to determine which elements has more votes
    - print the winner
