# Inheritance

## Lab 6: Inheritance

### Challenges
- getting the classes to relate without using inheritance
- create restaurant class
- create review class
- create ```addReview(Review)``` to restaurant class

### Approach
- using a form of composition, by creating an instance of the review class in the restaurant class.
- test constructors for both restaurant and review classes
- test ```toString()``` for both restaurant and review classes
- test to make sure ```addReview(Review)``` is actually adding a review to the restaurant and affecting the restaurants star rating.
